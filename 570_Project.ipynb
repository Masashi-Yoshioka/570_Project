    "There has been a huge discussion about whether we can estimate a treatment effect using nonexperimental data. The answer still remains to be seen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This topic was first introduced by LaLonde (1986). He used data from randomized experiments that were conducted as a part of the NSW (the details will be explained in 2.1) and investigated the extent to which nonexperimental ATE estimates of the NSW can replicate experimental estimates. He first obtained the experimental ATE estimates from randomized experiments by, for example, taking a difference between averages of treatment and control groups, which would be an unbiased estimate for the ATE as long as the experiments were truly randomized. Then, he compared the results with the estimates from nonexperimental data (CPS and PSID namely) that were obtained using several econometric methods. He basically failed to obtain the nonexperimental ATE estimates that are close to experimental ones and concluded that the standard nonexperimental estimation methods are inaccurate relative to experimental benchmarks or sensitive to the modeling specifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) used the same dataset as LaLonde (1986) and concluded that they could successfully obtain the nonexprimental ATET estimates that were close to the benchmark experimental estimate by propensity score methods. They first provided a theoretical discussion about unconfoundedness and propensity score, and then applied the propensity score matching to the data of LaLonde (1986). They claimed that although the propensity score method cannot in principle account for important unobservables if any, it is still worth exploring first the information contained in the observable covariates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Smith and Todd (2005) pointed out that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) had excluded some samples from the data of LaLonde (1986), which should have made it easier to estimate the ATET by nonexperimental data. They applied  to original LaLonde (1986) dataset the same propensity score matching method that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) had used, and discovered that the estimates were very sensitive to the choice of variables used in the propensity score estimation and the choice of samples of analysis. They concluded that the propensity score matching would not represent a general solution to causal inferences whereas it is a potentially useful tool.  "

Our research question is very important from the empirical perspective because experimental data are rarely available in economics. We often need to use nonexperimental data to evaluate the effect of a certain program. Finding a causal relationship from nonexperimental data is obviously one of the most important tasks of econometrics, but it might not provide a correct estimation in general if the suggestions by LaLonde (1986) and Smith and Todd (2005) are true."

    "To answer our research question, we will use the dataset of LaLonde (1986) and try to estimate the ATE and/or ATET of the NSW by applying a variety of methods. We will first apply regression (or imputation estimator) methods. Then, we will rely on different estimation methods that use propensity score, namely propensity score matching, Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and doubly robust estimators. In addition to the logistic regression that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) used to estimate propensity score, we will use Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to examine whether machine learning approaches can improve the estimation. We will use both the original data of LaLonde (1986) and its subset selected by Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) to see if the criticism by Smith and Todd (2005) holds true.  \n",

    "We use a dataset from the NSW Demonstration, which has been commonly used in the causal inference literature, including LaLonde (1986), Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) and Smith and Todd (2005) as explained above. \n",

    "The NSW was a job training program conducted in the mid-1970s at 15 sites around the United States. Our dataset is focused on the program implemented in 10 sites from April 1975 to August 1977 among others. The program was targeted at 4 types of hard-to-employ people: female long-term AFDC<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) recipients, ex-drug addicts, ex-climinal offenders and high school dropouts. The potential participants had to satisfy a set of eligibility criteria that included: (i) they must have been currently unemployed, (ii) they must have spent no more than 3 months on one regular job of at least 20 hours per week during the preceding 6 months, and so forth. These criteria as well as self-selection made the participants in NSW differ from the U.S. population in many characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program operated as a randomized experiment by randomly assigning some applicants to a control group that was not allowed to participate in the program. For those assigned to the treatment group, the program guaranteed a job for 9 to 18 months, depending on the target group and site. The program paid the treatment group for their work, but the offered wage was lower than they would have received on a regular job. The participants were forced to find a regular job after their terms in the program expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment and control groups were interviewed five times in total, one of which was a baseline and the others were follow-ups. Many people failed to complete these interviews and thus the sample attrition could have possibly caused biases. However, LaLonde (1986) suggests that the largest source of attrition, which is the interview schedule according to LaLonde (1986), should not affect the integrity of the experimental design because the interviews were randomly scheduled. Here we just assume that LaLonde (1986) is right and will not deal with the potential sample attrition problem. The interviews provide information on demographic characteristics, employment history, household income and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the effect of the NSW on earnings of participants. Since the program randomly assigned applicants to treatment and control groups, the experimental data would presumably give us an unbiased estimate for the average treatment effect (ATE) of the program. LaLonde (1986) compared the experimental data with nonexperimental data such as Current Population Survey (CPS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), concluding that nonexperimental data fail to generate similar results to experimental data. Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) concentrate on subsamples whose earnings in 1974 are available, and conclude that propensity-score matching would generate the results close to experimental design. Thus, our dataset consists of 6 different groups of samples: treatment group in LaLonde (1986), control group in LaLonde (1986), treatment subgroup in Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), control subgroup in Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), nonexperimental data from CPS and those from PSID. Using the dataset, we will see if nonexperimental data can generate estimates that are close enough to those given by experimental data."

This repository also includes the subsamples of CPS and PSID that were chosen by LaLonde (1986) to make them resemble the NSW applicants to the extent possible. However, according to Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), choosing subsamples arbitrarily from the nonexperimental data would not improve the estimate. Thus, we will use the 6 groups described in 2.1 and discard subsamples of CPS and PSID. For the same reason, we will not do any sample restrictions including removing outliers from the data. Since the experiment was randomized, using all the samples would give an unbiased estimate of ATE. On the other hand, arbitrary sample restrictions can make treatment and control groups incomparable, which could cause a bias in the estimate."

    "The above table shows the conditional mean of each characteristic. We can see that the NSW experimental data are totally different from CPS and PSID. As we have already seen above, the average age is much lower in the NSW data than in CPS/PSID. In addition, compared to CPS/PSID, the NSW samples have the lower average year of education, much more black people, more hispanic people, more singles and more dropouts. These differences are not surprising considering the eligibility criteria for the NSW. Moreover, the average earnings of the NSW samples are much lower than those of CPS/PSID. Therefore, it is obvious that taking differences between experimental treatment group and *nonexperimental* control group would not provide a good estimate of the effect of the program."

    "As a notation, we will let $D$ denote the treatment variable (`treat`), $X$ denote the covariates and $Y$ denote the outcome below. Since `re74` is not available for LaLonde (1986) dataset, we define $X$ by the other pre-treatment variables, i.e., `age`, `education`, `black`, `hispanic`, `married`, `nodegree` and `re75`. We assume two kinds of outcomes, difference in earnings between 1975 and 1978 (`dif`) and earnings in 1978 (`re78`), as $Y$. If the experiment is randomized, the choice of $Y$ would not affect the estimates because the pre-treatment variable `re75` should be comparable between treatment and control groups under randomized selection. On the other hand, it can affect the estimates when using nonexperimental data. We will assume both outcomes to make our research comprehensive."

It is fairly robust to overfitting and frequently wins in machine learning competitions (Müller & Guido, 2016). We expect that it can provide different nonlinear estimations of $Y = f(D, X)$ than Random Forest and make our analysis robust and comprehensive.  \n",

The main finding is that PSID control group could generate similar treatment effect as the experiment data does for the Lalonde data when the outcome variable is 're78 - re75'. Their difference is only about 70 under both method, while the difference is more than 700 for the DW's data. It somehow provides the support for the conjecture that the linear specification may be wrong when estimating the non-experiment treatment effect."

For the Lalonde data, the treatment effect remains negative if it uses logit regression to estimate the propensity score. The main finding here is that CPS control group, given the outcome variable 're78 - re75' and random forest method to estimate the propensity score, could generate 794 average treatment effect on the treated, which is very close to the true treatment effect 819 estimated by linear regression and 793 estimated by Gradient Boosting.\n",

It still remain negative for all the average treatment effect in the Lalonde data and for the average treatment effect using PSID control group in the DW data. The main finding here is that CPS control group in the DW data could generate similar result as the true treatment effect, especially when it uses random forest to estimate $\\mu$. It generates 1233 when 're78 - re75' works as the outcome variable and 1253 when 're78' does, and they are very close to true treatment effect 1375 estimated by linear regression, 1335 estimated by Random Forest and 1124 estimated by Gradient Boosting."

    "In conclusion, this paper conducts several estimation methods to investigate the non-experiment treatment effect with the CPS and PSID data. Although it finds that under some conditions that the non-experiment data could generate similar results as the experiment data does, the results are very sensitive to the outcome variable, the estimation method and the control group. Therefore, it should be cautious to reach the conclusion that we can estimate casual effects in NSW using non-experiment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Propensity Score Matching estimation, it could generate similar results for Lalonde data and DW data that CPS control group could replicate the true treatment, with only the exception that they need to use different method to estimate the propensity score. However, the results differ between Lalonde and DW data in other estimation strategies.\n",
    "PSID could replicate the results for Lalonde data in the Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression, while CPS does for DW data in the Doubly Robust Estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this results could somehow provide support for Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) that propensity score matching estimation could alleviate the bias due to systematic differences between the treated and comparison units and replicate the causal effect in NSW with non-experiment dataset."

    "We re-examined whether the causal effect can be estimated of the NSW with nonexperimental data, which is a long-standing debate, by incorporating various machine learning methods, such as Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression, into the causal inference and trying various specifications. Our analysis provides new arguments to support the conclusion of DW, while reconcile the possibility that Lalonde and DW have different conclusions due to different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis, we mainly leads to two conclusions. First, our study estimating causal effects in NSW using nonexperimental data is not generalizable, and it depends on the outcome variable, estimation method, and control group. Second, the results for Lalonde and DW are different under the same model, and using different methods for estimation may yield similar results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future research, firstly, we can try to find a way to enhance the robustness of the results so that the model can be widely applicable to the estimation of the casual effect in a specific context. Furthermore, we can focus on how to choose an appropriate model without experimental data, because in economics research, there is no random experiment in most situations, so how to identify the best specification in this case is the key to the problem."
