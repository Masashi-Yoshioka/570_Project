    "There has been a huge discussion about whether we can estimate a treatment effect using nonexperimental data. The answer still remains to be seen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimation of the causal effect of the NSW was first introduced by LaLonde (1986). He used data from randomized experiments conducted as a part of the NSW (the details will be explained in 2.1) and investigated the extent to which nonexperimental ATE estimates of the NSW can replicate experimental estimates. He first obtained the experimental ATE estimates from randomized experiments by, for example, taking a difference between averages of treatment and control groups, which would be an unbiased estimate for the ATE as long as the experiments were truly randomized. Then, he compared the results with the estimates from nonexperimental data (namely, CPS and PSID) obtained by several econometric methods. He failed to replicate the experimental estimates by nonexperimental data and concluded that the standard nonexperimental estimation methods are inaccurate relative to experimental benchmarks and sensitive to the modeling specifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) applied propensity score methods to the same dataset as LaLonde (1986) and concluded that they could successfully obtain the nonexprimental ATET estimates that were close to the experimental benchmarks. They claimed that although propensity score methods cannot account for important unobservables if any, it is still worth exploring the information contained in the observable covariates first, and propensity score matching methods can alleviate the bias due to systematic differences between treatment and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Smith and Todd (2005) pointed out that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) had excluded some samples from the original data of LaLonde (1986), which should have made it easier to estimate the ATET by nonexperimental data. They applied to the original LaLonde (1986) dataset the same propensity score matching method that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) had used, and discovered that the estimates were very sensitive to the choice of variables used in the propensity score estimation and the choice of samples of analysis. They concluded that the propensity score matching would not represent a general solution to causal inferences whereas it is potentially a useful tool."

Our research question is extremely important from the empirical perspective because experimental data are rarely available in economics. We often need to use nonexperimental data to evaluate the effect of a certain program. Finding a causal relationship from nonexperimental data is one of the most important tasks of econometrics, but unfortunately, it might not provide a correct estimation of ATE/ATET if the arguments of LaLonde (1986) and Smith and Todd (2005) hold true in general."

    "To answer our research question, we will use the dataset of LaLonde (1986) and try to estimate the ATE and/or the ATET of the NSW by applying a variety of methods. We will first apply regression (i.e., imputation) methods. Then, we will rely on different estimation methods that use propensity score, namely propensity score matching, Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and doubly robust estimators. In addition to the logistic regression that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) used to estimate the propensity score, we will also use Random Forest and Gradient Boosting in order to examine whether machine learning approaches can improve the estimation. We will use both the original data of LaLonde (1986) and its subset selected by Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) to see if the criticism by Smith and Todd (2005) holds true.  \n",

    "We use a dataset from the NSW Demonstration, which has been commonly used in the causal inference literature, including LaLonde (1986), Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) and Smith and Todd (2005) as explained above. \n",

    "The NSW was a job training program conducted in the mid-1970s at 15 sites around the U.S. Our dataset is focused on the program implemented in 10 sites from April 1975 to August 1977 among others. The program was targeted at 4 types of hard-to-employ people: female long-term AFDC<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) recipients, ex-drug addicts, ex-climinal offenders and high school dropouts. The potential participants had to satisfy a set of eligibility criteria that included: (i) they must have been currently unemployed, (ii) they must have spent no more than 3 months on one regular job of at least 20 hours per week during the preceding 6 months, and so forth. These criteria as well as self-selection made the participants in NSW essentially differ from the U.S. population in many characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program operated as a randomized experiment by randomly assigning some applicants to a control group that was not allowed to participate in the program. For those assigned to the treatment group, the program guaranteed a job for 9 to 18 months, depending on the target group and site. The program paid the treatment group for their work, but the offered wage was lower than they would have received on a regular job. The participants were forced to find a regular job after their terms in the program expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment and control groups were interviewed five times in total, one of which was a baseline and the others were follow-ups. Many people failed to complete these interviews and thus the sample attrition could have possibly caused biases. However, LaLonde (1986) suggests that the largest source of attrition, which was supposedly the interview schedule, should not have affected the integrity of the experimental design because the interviews were randomly scheduled. Here we just assume that LaLonde (1986) is right and will not deal with the potential sample attrition problem. The interviews provide information on demographic characteristics, employment history, household income and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the effect of the NSW on earnings of participants. Since the program randomly assigned applicants to treatment and control groups, the experimental data would presumably give us an unbiased estimate for the average treatment effect (ATE) of the program. LaLonde (1986) compared the experimental data with nonexperimental data such as Current Population Survey (CPS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), concluding that nonexperimental data fail to generate similar results to experimental data. Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) concentrated on subsamples whose earnings in 1974 are available, and concluded that propensity-score matching would generate the results close to experimental design. Thus, our dataset consists of 6 different groups of samples: experimental treatment group in LaLonde (1986), experimental control group in LaLonde (1986), experimental treatment subgroup in Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), experimental control subgroup in Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), nonexperimental data from CPS, and nonexperimental data from PSID. Using the dataset, we will see if nonexperimental data can generate estimates that are close enough to those given by experimental data."

Note that it only includes the male samples due to the data availability of LaLonde (1986) whereas LaLonde (1986) analyzed the female samples as well. Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) and Smith and Todd (2005) focused on males for the same reason. This repository also includes the subsamples of CPS and PSID that were chosen by LaLonde (1986) to make them resemble the NSW applicants to the extent possible. However, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) argued that choosing subsamples arbitrarily from the nonexperimental data would not improve the estimate. Smith and Todd (2005) also ignored these subsamples. Thus, we have decided to use the 6 groups described in 2.1 and discard subsamples of CPS and PSID. For the same reason, we do not do any sampling restrictions including outlier removal in order to avoid the potential bias from arbitrary selection of subsamples. Since the experiment was randomized, using all the samples would give an unbiased estimate of ATE. On the other hand, arbitrary sample restrictions can make treatment and control groups incomparable, which could cause a bias in the estimate."

For instance, earnings in 1975 (`re75`) of treatment group are higher than those of control group, although the difference does not appear to be statistically significant. By choosing only the subsamples whose earnings in 1974 were available, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) might have distorted the samples and hurt the comparability between treatment and control groups as argued by Smith and Todd (2005)."

In addition, compared to CPS/PSID, the experimental samples have the lower average year of education, much more black people, more hispanic people, more singles and more dropouts. These differences are not surprising considering the eligibility criteria for the NSW. Moreover, the average earnings of the NSW samples are much lower than those of CPS/PSID. Therefore, it is obvious that taking differences between experimental treatment group and *nonexperimental* control group would not provide a good estimate of the causal effect of the program because they are totally incomparable."

    "As a notation, we will let $D$ denote the treatment variable (`treat`), $X$ denote the covariates and $Y$ denote the outcome henceforth. Since `re74` is not available for LaLonde dataset, we define $X$ by the other pre-treatment variables, i.e., `age`, `education`, `black`, `hispanic`, `married`, `nodegree` and `re75`. We assume two kinds of outcomes, difference in earnings between 1975 and 1978 (`dif`) and earnings in 1978 (`re78`), as $Y$. If the experiment is randomized, the choice of $Y$ would not affect the ATE/ATET estimates because the pre-treatment variable `re75` should be comparable between treatment and control groups under randomized selection. On the other hand, it could affect the estimates when we rely on nonexperimental data. Thus, we assume both outcomes to make our research comprehensive."

    "The matching method essentially tries to estimate ATET by choosing a comparable sample of treatment group from control group. Therefore, in order for the method to work, the distribution of matched control samples should be similar to that of the treated samples. In this subsection, we first try to estimate the propensity score by three methods, logistic regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and match the samples based on the estimates. Then, we compare the distribution of matched nonexperimental samples with that of treatment group and see whether the matching method could choose comparable samples from nonexperimental control group."

For the Lalonde data, the treatment effect remains negative if it uses logit regression to estimate the propensity score. The main finding here is that CPS control group, given the outcome variable 're78 - re75' and random forest method to estimate the propensity score, could generate 794 average treatment effect on the treated, which is very close to the true treatment effect 819 estimated by linear regression and 793 estimated by Gradient Boosting.\n",

It still remain negative for all the average treatment effect in the Lalonde data and for the average treatment effect using PSID control group in the DW data. The main finding here is that CPS control group in the DW data could generate similar result as the true treatment effect, especially when it uses random forest to estimate $\\mu$. It generates 1233 when 're78 - re75' works as the outcome variable and 1253 when 're78' does, and they are very close to true treatment effect 1375 estimated by linear regression, 1335 estimated by Random Forest and 1124 estimated by Gradient Boosting."

    "In conclusion, this paper conducts several estimation methods to investigate the non-experiment treatment effect with the CPS and PSID data. Although it finds that under some conditions that the non-experiment data could generate similar results as the experiment data does, the results are very sensitive to the outcome variable, the estimation method and the control group. Therefore, it should be cautious to reach the conclusion that we can estimate casual effects in NSW using non-experiment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Propensity Score Matching estimation, it could generate similar results for Lalonde data and DW data that CPS control group could replicate the true treatment, with only the exception that they need to use different method to estimate the propensity score. However, the results differ between Lalonde and DW data in other estimation strategies.\n",
    "PSID could replicate the results for Lalonde data in the Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression, while CPS does for DW data in the Doubly Robust Estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this results could somehow provide support for Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) that propensity score matching estimation could alleviate the bias due to systematic differences between the treated and comparison units and replicate the causal effect in NSW with non-experiment dataset."

    "We re-examined whether the causal effect can be estimated of the NSW with nonexperimental data, which is a long-standing debate, by incorporating various machine learning methods, such as Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression, into the causal inference and trying various specifications. Our analysis provides new arguments to support the conclusion of DW, while reconcile the possibility that Lalonde and DW have different conclusions due to different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis, we mainly leads to two conclusions. First, our study estimating causal effects in NSW using nonexperimental data is not generalizable, and it depends on the outcome variable, estimation method, and control group. Second, the results for Lalonde and DW are different under the same model, and using different methods for estimation may yield similar results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future research, firstly, we can try to find a way to enhance the robustness of the results so that the model can be widely applicable to the estimation of the casual effect in a specific context. Furthermore, we can focus on how to choose an appropriate model without experimental data, because in economics research, there is no random experiment in most situations, so how to identify the best specification in this case is the key to the problem."
