    "\n",
    "Many literatures have been exploring whether non-experimental data can estimate treatment effects without bias. One way to evaluate econometric methods is to compare them with experimentally determined results. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main papers use data from the National Supported Work Demonstration experiment to study the performance of econometric estimators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lalonde(1986) first uses data from a randomized evaluation program. He investigated the extent to which non-experimental estimates can replicate unbiased experimental estimates of treatment effects when applied to a combined dataset of experimental treatment units and non-experimental comparison units. He concluded that standard non-experimental estimation methods, such as regression, fixed effects, and potential variable selection models, are either inaccurate relative to experimental benchmarks or sensitive to the specifications used in regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Dehejia and Wahba(1999) demonstrate the estimates of the training effect for Lalonde's hybrid of an experimental and non-experimental dataset are close to the benchmark experimental estimate when using propensity score methods. They conclude that although the method cannot account some important unobservable covariates, there are still substantial rewards in exploring first the information contained in the variables that are observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when Simth and Todd(2005) applied the same methods to other reasonable samples from the NSW data which is different from DW used, the low bias results disappear. They discovered that the NSW impact estimates based on propensity score matching were very sensitive to both the variables included in the scores and the particular sample of analyses used in the estimates. They also found that the difference-in-difference match estimator performed best among cross-sectional matching, propensity score matching, and difference-in-difference estimation in all of their studies. Their findings show that while propensity score matching is a potentially useful econometric tool, it does not represent a general solution to the evaluation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on two questions and evaluate the experimental results of Lalonde and Dehejia through multiple methods. First, can we estimate causal effects in the National Supported Work (NSW) using nonexperimental data? Second, do the results differ between LaLonde (1986) dataset and Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) subset? To answer the questions, we reproduces the methods of Lalonde (1986) and Dehejia and Wahba (1999) and adds a machine learning approach for comparison, and additionally applies the Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) estimator and the double robust estimator to data from the National Supported Work (NSW) demonstration project.\n"

    "We use a dataset from the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, which has been commonly used in the causal inference literature, including LaLonde (1986), Dehejia and Wahba (1999) and Smith and Todd (2005) as explained above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NSW was a job training program conducted in the mid-1970s at 15 sites around the United States. Our dataset is focused on the program implemented in 10 sites from April 1975 to August 1977 among others. The program was targeted at 4 types of hard-to-employ people: female long-term AFDC<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) recipients, ex-drug addicts, ex-climinal offenders and high school dropouts. The potential participants had to satisfy a set of eligibility criteria that included: (i) they must have been currently unemployed, (ii) they must have spent no more than 3 months on one regular job of at least 20 hours per week during the preceding 6 months, and so forth. These criteria as well as self-selection made the participants in NSW differ from the U.S. population in many characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program operated as a randomized experiment by randomly assigning some applicants to a control group that was not allowed to participate in the program. For those assigned to the treatment group, the program guaranteed a job for 9 to 18 months, depending on the target group and site. The program paid the treatment group for their work, but the offered wage was lower than they would have received on a regular job. The participants were forced to find a regular job after their terms in the program expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment and control groups were interviewed five times in total, one of which was a baseline and the others were follow-ups. Many people failed to complete these interviews and thus the sample attrition could have possibly caused biases. However, LaLonde (1986) suggests that the largest source of attrition, which is the interview schedule according to LaLonde (1986), should not affect the integrity of the experimental design because the interviews were randomly scheduled. Here we just assume that LaLonde (1986) is right and will not deal with the potential sample attrition problem. The interviews provide information on demographic characteristics, employment history, household income and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the effect of the NSW on earnings of participants. Since the program randomly assigned applicants to treatment and control groups, the experimental data would presumably give us an unbiased estimate for the average treatment effect (ATE) of the program. LaLonde (1986) compared the experimental data with nonexperimental data such as Current Population Survey (CPS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), concluding that nonexperimental data fail to generate similar results to experimental data. Dehejia and Wahba (1999) concentrate on subsamples whose earnings in 1974 are available, and conclude that propensity-score matching would generate the results close to experimental design. Thus, our dataset consists of 6 different groups of samples: treatment group in LaLonde (1986), control group in LaLonde (1986), treatment subgroup in Dehejia and Wahba (1999), control subgroup in Dehejia and Wahba (1999), nonexperimental data from CPS and those from PSID. Using the dataset, we will see if nonexperimental data can generate estimates that are close enough to those given by experimental data."

Note that it only includes the male samples due to the data availability of LaLonde (1986). That is why Dehejia and Wahba (1999) and Smith and Todd (2005) also focus on males. This repository also includes the subsamples of CPS and PSID that were chosen by LaLonde (1986) to make them resemble the NSW applicants to the extent possible. However, according to Dehejia and Wahba (1999), choosing subsamples arbitrarily from the nonexperimental data would not improve the estimate. Thus, we will use the 6 groups described in 2.1 and discard subsamples of CPS and PSID. For the same reason, we will not do any sample restrictions including removing outliers from the data. Since the experiment was randomized, using all the samples would give an unbiased estimate of ATE. On the other hand, arbitrary sample restrictions can make treatment and control groups incomparable, which could cause a bias in the estimate."

    "The above table shows the conditional mean of each characteristic. We can see that the NSW experimental data are totally different from CPS and PSID. As we have already seen above, the average age is much lower in the NSW data than in CPS/PSID. In addition, compared to CPS/PSID, the NSW samples have the lower average year of education, much more black people, more hispanic people, more singles and more dropouts. These differences are not surprising considering the eligibility criteria for the NSW. Moreover, the average earnings of the NSW samples are much lower than those of CPS/PSID. Therefore, it is obvious that taking differences between experimental treatment group and *nonexperimental* control group would not provide a good estimate of the effect of the program."

The main finding is that PSID control group could generate similar treatment effect as the experiment data does for the Lalonde data when the outcome variable is 're78 - re75'. Their difference is only about 70 under both method, while the difference is more than 700 for the DW's data. It somehow provides the support for the conjecture that the linear specification may be wrong when estimating the non-experiment treatment effect."

    "The fourth table shows the results of treatment effect estimated by Propensity Score Matching, where it uses logit regression or random forest to estimate the propensity score. For the Lalonde data, the treatment effect remains negative if it uses logit regression to estimate the propensity score. The main finding here is that CPS control group, given the outcome variable 're78 - re75' and random forest method to estimate the propensity score, could generate 794 average treatment effect on the treated, which is very close to the true treatment effect 819 estimated by linear regression and 793 estimated by Gradient Boosting.\n",

The main finding in DW data here is that if it uses logit regression to estimate the propensity score, CPS control group could generate 1324 average treatment effect when the outcome variable is 're78 - re75' and 1229 average treatment effect when the outcome variable is 're78', they are very close to true treatment effect 1375 estimated by linear regression, 1335 estimated by Random Forest and 1124 estimated by Gradient Boosting.\n",

    "The last table shows the results of treatment effect estimated by Doubly Robust Estimation. It still remain negative for all the average treatment effect in the Lalonde data and for the average treatment effect using PSID control group in the DW data. The main finding here is that CPS control group in the DW data could generate similar result as the true treatment effect, especially when it uses random forest to estimate $\\mu$. It generates 1233 when 're78 - re75' works as the outcome variable and 1253 when 're78' does, and they are very close to true treatment effect 1375 estimated by linear regression, 1335 estimated by Random Forest and 1124 estimated by Gradient Boosting."

    "In conclusion, this paper conducts several estimation methods to investigate the non-experiment treatment effect with the CPS and PSID data. Although it finds that under some conditions that the non-experiment data could generate similar results as the experiment data does, the results are very sensitive to the outcome variable, the estimation method and the control group. Therefore, it should be cautious to reach the conclusion that we can estimate casual effects in NSW using non-experiment data.\n",

    "In the Propensity Score Matching estimation, it could generate similar results for Lalonde data and DW data that CPS control group could replicate the true treatment, with only the exception that they need to use different method to estimate the propensity score. However, the results differ between Lalonde and DW data in other estimation strategies.\n",
    "PSID could replicate the results for Lalonde data in the Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression, while CPS does for DW data in the Doubly Robust Estimation. \n",

    "Overall, this results could somehow provide support for Dehejia and Wahba(1999) and Dehejia and Wahba(2002) that propensity score matching estimation could alleviate the bias due to systematic differences between the treated and comparison units and replicate the causal effect in NSW with non-experiment dataset.\n",
