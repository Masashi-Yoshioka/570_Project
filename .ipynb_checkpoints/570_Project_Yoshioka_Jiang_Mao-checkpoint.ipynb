    "There has been a huge discussion about whether we can estimate treatment effect with nonexperimental data. The answer still remains to be seen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The nonexperimental estimation of the causal effect of the NSW was first introduced by LaLonde (1986). He used data from randomized experiments conducted as a part of the NSW (the details will be explained in 2.1) and investigated the extent to which nonexperimental ATE estimates of the NSW can replicate experimental ones. He first obtained experimental ATE estimates from the randomized experiments by, for example, taking a difference in post-treatment earnings between treatment and control groups, which would be an unbiased estimate for ATE as long as the experiments were truly randomized. Then, he compared the results with the estimates from nonexperimental data (namely, CPS and PSID) obtained through several econometric methods. He failed to replicate the experimental estimates with nonexperimental data and concluded that the standard nonexperimental estimation methods are inaccurate relative to experimental benchmarks and sensitive to the modeling specifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) applied propensity score methods to the same dataset as LaLonde (1986) and concluded that they could successfully obtain nonexprimental ATET estimates that were close to experimental benchmarks. They claimed that although propensity score methods cannot account for important unobservables if any, it is still worth exploring the information contained in the observable covariates first, and propensity score matching methods can reduce the bias due to systematic differences between treatment and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Smith and Todd (2005) pointed out that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) had excluded some samples from the original dataset of LaLonde (1986), which should have made it easier to estimate ATET with nonexperimental data. They applied to the original dataset of LaLonde (1986) the same propensity score matching method that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) had used, and discovered that the estimates were very sensitive to the choice of variables used in the propensity score estimation and the choice of samples of analysis. They concluded that the propensity score matching would not represent a general solution to causal inferences whereas it is potentially a useful tool."

Our research question is extremely important from the empirical perspective because experimental data are rarely available in economics and we often need to rely on nonexperimental data to evaluate causal effect of a program. Finding a causal relationship from nonexperimental data is one of the most important tasks of econometrics, but unfortunately, econometrics might not provide a correct estimation of treatment effect if the arguments of LaLonde (1986) and Smith and Todd (2005) hold true in general."

    "To answer our research question, we will use the dataset of LaLonde (1986) and apply a variety of methods to estimate ATE and ATET of the NSW on earnings. We will first apply regression methods. Then, we will use different estimation methods that rely on propensity score, namely propensity score matching, Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) estimator and doubly robust estimator. In addition to logistic regression that Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) used to estimate the propensity score, we will also use Random Forest and Gradient Boosting in order to examine whether machine learning approaches can improve the propensity score estimation. We will use both the original data of LaLonde (1986) and its subset selected by Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) to see if the criticism by Smith and Todd (2005) holds true.  \n",

    "We use a dataset from the NSW Demonstration, which has been commonly used in the causal inference literature, including LaLonde (1986), Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) and Smith and Todd (2005) as explained above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NSW was a job training program conducted in the mid-1970s at 15 sites around the U.S. Our dataset is focused on the program implemented in 10 sites from April 1975 to August 1977 in particular. The program was targeted at 4 types of hard-to-employ people: female long-term AFDC<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) recipients, ex-drug addicts, ex-climinal offenders and high school dropouts. The potential participants had to satisfy a set of eligibility criteria that included: i) they must have been currently unemployed, ii) they must have spent no more than 3 months on one regular job of at least 20 hours per week during the preceding 6 months, and so forth. These criteria as well as self-selection made the participants in the NSW essentially differ from the U.S. population in many characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program operated as a randomized experiment by randomly assigning some applicants to a control group that was not allowed to participate in the program. For those assigned to the treatment group, the program guaranteed a job for 9 to 18 months, depending on the target group and site. The program paid the treatment group for their work, but the offered wage was lower than they would have received on a regular job. The participants were forced to find a regular job after their terms in the program expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment and control groups were interviewed 5 times in total, one of which was a baseline and the others were follow-ups. Many people failed to complete these interviews and thus the sample attrition could have possibly caused biases. However, LaLonde (1986) suggests that the largest source of attrition, which was supposedly the interview schedule, should not have affected the integrity of the experimental design because the interviews were randomly scheduled. Here we just assume that LaLonde (1986) is right and will not deal with the potential sample attrition problem. The interviews provide information on demographic characteristics, employment history, household income and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the causal effect of the NSW on earnings of participants. Since the program randomly assigned applicants to treatment and control groups, the experimental data would give us an unbiased ATE estimate of the program. LaLonde (1986) compared the experimental data with nonexperimental data such as Current Population Survey (CPS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), concluding that the nonexperimental data fail to generate similar results to those of experimental data. Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) concentrated on subsamples whose earnings in 1974 were available, and concluded that propensity score matching could generate the results close to experimental ones. Since we use both data of LaLonde (1986) and those of Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), our dataset consists of 6 different groups of samples: experimental treatment group of LaLonde (1986), experimental control group of LaLonde (1986), experimental treatment subgroup of Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), experimental control subgroup of Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), nonexperimental data from CPS, and nonexperimental data from PSID. Using the dataset, we will see if nonexperimental data can generate estimates that are close enough to experimental results."

However, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) argued that choosing subsamples arbitrarily from the nonexperimental data would not improve the estimates. Smith and Todd (2005) also ignored these subsamples. Thus, we have decided to use 6 groups described in 2.1 and discard subsamples of CPS and PSID. For the same reason, we do not do any sampling restrictions including outlier removal in order to avoid the potential bias from arbitrary selection of subsamples. Since the experiment was randomized, using all the experimental samples would give an unbiased estimate of ATE. On the other hand, arbitrary sample restrictions can make treatment and control groups incomparable, which could cause a bias in the estimate even if the experiments were randomized.  \n",

In addition, compared to CPS/PSID, the experimental samples have less average year of education, much more black people, more singles and more dropouts. These differences are not surprising considering the eligibility criteria for the NSW as we have seen in 2.1. Moreover, the average earnings of the NSW samples are much lower than those of CPS/PSID. Therefore, it is obvious that simply taking differences between experimental treatment group and *nonexperimental* control group would not provide a good estimate of the causal effect of the NSW because they are totally incomparable in many characteristics."

    "As a notation, we will let $D$ denote the treatment variable (`treat`), $X$ denote the covariates and $Y$ denote the outcome henceforth. Since `re74` is not available for LaLonde dataset, we define $X$ by the other pre-treatment variables, i.e., `age`, `education`, `black`, `hispanic`, `married`, `nodegree` and `re75`. We assume two kinds of outcomes $Y$, difference in earnings between 1975 and 1978 (`dif`) and earnings in 1978 (`re78`). If the experiments were randomized, the choice of $Y$ would not affect the estimates because the pre-treatment variable `re75` should be the same on average between treatment and control groups. On the other hand, it could affect the estimates when we rely on nonexperimental data. Thus, we assume both outcomes to make our research comprehensive."

    "The matching method essentially tries to estimate ATET by choosing a comparable sample with treatment group from control group. Therefore, in order for the method to work, the distribution of matched samples should be similar to that of the treated samples in pre-treatment characteristics. In this subsection, we first try to estimate the propensity score by three methods, logistic regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and match the samples based on the estimates. Then, we compare the distribution of matched nonexperimental samples with that of treated samples and see whether the matching method could successfully pick up comparable samples from nonexperimental data.  \n",

    "Note that we will omit samples with the estimated propensity score that is close to 0 or 1. Specifically, we will keep only the samples whose estimated propensity score satisfies $0.01 < \\hat{p}(X_i) < 0.99$ for 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. The trimming is common in propensity score methods, which basically sacrifices external validity for improved accuracy."

This observation is roughly consistent with Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) while their specification of logistic regression model is different from ours. They include, for example, squared values of `age`, `education` and `re75` and so forth.\n",

We can interpret the propensity score estimation as classification problem, that is, prediction problem of whether a sample is treated or controlled based on pre-treatment variables $X$. The function `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()` can solve the classification problem for us. The function also returns the estimated probability of being treated for each sample, which can be used for our propensity score estimate. Again, the hyperparameters for Random Forest, `n_estimators` and `max_features`, are tuned by 5-fold cross validation.  \n",

    "The above table and figure imply that, surprisingly, there are large differences between treatment and control groups. For example, **all** the matched samples from CPS have zero earnings in 1975. Furthermore, there are much more black people, dropouts and young people in the matched samples than in the treatment group of LaLonde dataset. Although these characteristics (i.e., black, dropouts, young and low earnings) were quite common in the NSW participants, Random Forest appears to have overcorrected the distribution of these variables in CPS. Therefore, unfortunately, we cannot expect that the matching based on Random Forest estimation would generate correct estimates of ATE/ATET.  \n",

    "The linear regression with nonexperimental data fails to generate similar estimates to experimental ones for both LaLonde dataset and DW subset. In addition, the nonexperimental estimates are very sensitive to the modeling specifications such as outcome variables, covariates and control groups. The column of `With all controls` should be identical between outcomes of `dif` and `re78` by design. However, the other columns show totally different values across different outcomes when nonexperimental data are used. The ATE/ATET estimates greatly differ across different covariates and different control groups (i.e., CPS or PSID).  \n",

    "The main finding is that we fail to replicate the experimental results with nonexperimental data. Although we could get relatively reliable estimates of ATET with DW subset, the estimates are sensitive to the choice of dependent variables and control groups. Even worse, these machine learning methods tend to generate lower estimates **with experimental data** than in linear regression, especially in the case of Gradient Boosting regression. Since linear regression would generate an unbiased estimate for ATE/ATET theoretically, this result implies that there might be a systematic downward bias in our Gradient Boosting regression estimator."

    "When logistic regression is used, ATE and ATET estimates are always negative with LaLonde dataset, regardless of the choices of control group, number of matched samples and caliper. On the other hand, ATET estimates with DW subset are almost always positive and some of them are close to benchmark estimates. This observation is somewhat consistent with Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002), but it is not robust to the choice of the maximum number of matched samples. The propensity score matching performs relatively well with DW subset and CPS, but it cannot be a general solution.\n",

In particular, the ATET estimates take extremely large negative values when PSID is used as a control group. Thus, although DW subset is relatively easy to estimate its ATET by propensity score matching, the estimate is neither robust nor accurate.\n",

    "We have conducted several estimation methods to investigate whether we can replicate experimental estimates of ATE and/or ATET with nonexperimental data, focusing on the effect of the job training program on earnings. Although nonexperimental data could generate similar results to experimental estimates under some conditions, they are very sensitive to modeling specifications such as the choice of outcome variable, control group and so forth. In other words, there is no single method that always works well in our setting. Thus, the answer to our research question would be simply **no**, as far as we have examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the propensity score estimation, Random Forest does not work well at all in our application. The propensity score estimated by logistic regression and Gradient Boosting can pick up samples that somehow resemble experimental samples from nonexperimental data, but the resulting estimates of ATE and ATET do not replicate the experimental results. Other methods that use propensity score such as IPTW estimator and doubly robust estimator also fail to generate accurate estimates. As a whole, our results imply that the assumption of unconfoundedness might not hold true with our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research suggests that researchers should be careful when they estimate causal effect of a program with nonexperimental data. Although unconfoundedness is often a reasonbale assumption, it can be violated as in our case. Researchers have to examine carefully whether unconfoundedness is likely to hold based on external knowledge such as economic theory, characteristics of samples and so forth. In our case, there are likely to be important omitted variables (e.g., motivation) that are systematically different between the NSW applicants and the U.S. population. Our failure in estimating ATE/ATET might be attributable to the fundamental problem that we cannot control for such important unobservables. \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the causal inference methods that we have applied could potentially provide answers to a variety of empirical questions in the future. The examples of questions include the following, all of which are very important in applied economics:\n",
    "- What is the causal effect of class size on student achievement?\n",
    "- What is the return to education?\n",
    "- Are there any gender wage discriminations?\n",
    "- What is the effect of medical insurance on medical expenditures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental data are rarely available in economics. Thus, in many situations, we have to assume unconfoundedness and control variables that can affect both treatment status and outcomes. In the case of the above examples, we have to control for a lot of variables such as teacher's quality, parents' income, ability of workers, health condition of insuree and so forth. Our methods provide different ways to control for variables, and thus can make these kinds of empirical researches more robust and comprehensive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, although our research is quite comprehensive in the sense that we have applied a lot of models and estimation methods, there is still something left that we can do in the future. One possible example would be Double Machine Learning, which can be a useful tool in the context of causal inferences. The method might give us further insight into the appropriate nonexperimental estimation of treatment effect."
